# Kaikebai_Face_Identification
For the last three days, I learned on an App KaiKeBa for such a project base upon face identification.
## Attention
The source code are mainly from the teacher, what's different in this code is that I repeated the whole operation by myself, in order to be familiar with how to execute a Java project.
Hence, if you don't like such a simple project, you can just have a glimpse of it!
